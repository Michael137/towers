{\Huge \bf Acknowledgements}

\vspace{24pt} 
I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Nada Amin and Prof. Alan Mycroft, for their advice and continuous feedback throughout this work. In my regular discussions with Prof. Mycroft he helped me contextualize my thoughts and provided out-of-the-box ideas that formed the basis for much of the work I chose to pursue during the course of my thesis. His meticulous attention to detail and emphasis on clear and concise explanations were of great assistance in structuring and writing my dissertation.

My project progress and understanding of fundamental topics in partial evaluation would not have been possible without the great advice and patience of Dr. Amin. Not only has she helped me with tracking down bugs with incredible speed but shaped the direction of research that the project ended up taking. She assisted with the implementations and design of the tower of interpreters I describe in the report and her ideas, including the staging of a string matcher and the decision on which interpreters the tower consists of, helped keep my project, despite its experimental nature, on the right track.

Finally I would like to thank friends, family and the staff at the computer laboratory for the great support and fruitful discussions throughout the course of my studies and help broaden my horizon in the field of computer science.
