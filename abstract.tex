A tower of interpreters is a program architecture that consists of a, conceptually infinite, sequence of interpreters each interpreting the one adjacent to it. Towers of interpreters in literature are synonymous with reflective towers and provide a tractable method with which to reason about reflection and design reflective languages. The overhead induced by additional layers of evaluation can be optimized away using a program specialization technique called \textit{partial evaluation}, a process which previous work has termed \textit{collapsing of towers of interpreters}. However, work on reflective towers rarely considered the implications and applicability of associated optimization techniques on practical settings in which the presence of redundant interpretation is commonplace. Our work recontextualizes prior work on reflective towers and the their collapse to \textit{heterogenous} configurations in which individual interpreters lack reflection, meta-circularity and homogeneity of data representation. First we demonstrate the construction of an experimental heterogeneous tower. Then we show evidence to support the hypothesis discussed in previous work that staging at different levels in the tower affects the optimality of the residual program. We identify obstacles that occur during the implementation of our experimental tower and the corresponding collapse procedure driven by \textit{type-directed partial evaluation (TDPE)}. As part of our tower we implement and stage a SECD abstract machine using TDPE which required the modification of its small-step semantics to support a TDPE-style reification operator and ensure termination of static reduction by normalization in the presence of recursive calls. Two core challenges we faced and provide approaches to are
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item in the absence of meta-circularity binding-time information has to be passed through all interpreters in a tower for optimal residualization
    \item due to the differences in the partial evaluator's and individual interpreters' representations of closures, we need a method of transforming between the two
\end{enumerate*}.
